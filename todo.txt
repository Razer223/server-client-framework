Add More events



CLIENT & SERVER: When other client disconnects leave that in other clients list, but set connected to false



Check for each parameter and make sure the type is same as on receiver

Remove from JsonSerializer and use bytes instead: // sender, target, type, is class, key, methodname?
And then use JsonSerializer for parameters only (not required either, since we have parse parameters array)


whyen other client connects this gets wrong ID on that client event

users shown multiple times


fix usage for same username (remove user from user list)


fix event on client when other client disconnects

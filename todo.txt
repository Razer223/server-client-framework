Add More events???

Check for each parameter and make sure the type is same as on receiver method and check amount

Remove from JsonSerializer and use bytes instead: // sender, target, type, is class, key, methodname?
And then use JsonSerializer for parameters only (not required either, since we have parse parameters array)



TODO send client METHODS only if requested by server


handle handshake timeout better
